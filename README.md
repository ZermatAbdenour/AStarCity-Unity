# A* Algorithm Implementation for Car Navigation in a City

This project implements the A* (A-star) algorithm in C# to navigate a car from a start point to an end point on a node-based map extracted from OpenStreetMap data. The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm widely used in robotics, gaming, and artificial intelligence applications.

## Features

- **A* Algorithm Implementation**: The project provides a C# implementation of the A* algorithm.
- **Node-based Map**: The navigation environment is represented as a graph where each node represents a location and edges represent roads extracted from OpenStreetMap data.
- **3D Model Visualization**: The project integrates 3D models of buildings and landmarks from CADMapper for visualization.
- **Start and End Point Definition**: Users can define the start and end points on the map for the car to navigate between.
## Demo
The demo is in Amizour, Bejaia, Algeria.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository :


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZermatAbdenour/astar-car-navigation.git
```
2. Open the project in the UnityEditor .
3. Run the Demo Scene
4. Watch the visualization of the car navigating the map using the A* algorithm, with 3D models of buildings and landmarks from CADMapper.
